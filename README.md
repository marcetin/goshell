# GoLang

My first program in GoLang.
You'll find in Pim/ the "pim" package which is quite simple to make, but I couldn't find a such package on the internet (which does exactly this) so I made it.

This is a Go-terminal. It provides ls, cat, create, and other will (maybe) come later.
Feel free to fork it or to ask if you want to take part of this project.
